Commit graded: 1672102fb6a27d4aafc064db35d02600b9c42544

### The product backlog (10/10)
•	A spreadsheet-like format is easier to read for backlogs, rather than prose or bulleted lists.  You could also explore existing online tools for generating and tracking work on a project.
•	Next time provide a cost estimate for each feature, in hours.  If the cost estimate is more than 5 or 8 hours, consider breaking the feature into smaller work units to improve their ability to track progress on it.


### Data models (10/10)
•	Relationship between project and task should not be a foreign key. Should be able to have multiple tasks per project 

### Wireframes or mock-ups (9/10)
•	Please include images or html next time
